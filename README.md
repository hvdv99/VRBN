# 👋 Welcome

## ℹ️ About this project
This repository is the home of a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) web application. This project helps  retrieving information out a large collection of documents.


## 🔧 Technologies used
* Flask: For a lightweight and efficient backend.
* Bootstrap: To create a responsive and visually appealing front-end design.
* Docker: To create a runtime environment that is system independent. 
* Google Cloud Platform: For document handling and container hosting.

## ✅ Project status
It's important to note that this is a starting point, the application is a work in progress. It demonstrates core RAG 
functionalities but to evolve this application from its current PoC state into a robust, production-ready tool, other
features must be implemented.
