# About
This repository contains the source code for a proof of concept (PoC) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tool carried 
out for Veiligheidsregio Brabant Noord.

It was build using Flask, Bootstrap and Docker. For document handling, it uses Google Cloud Storage. Please note that 
this is a PoC and it needs more work in order for the application to evolve to a rigid production app.
